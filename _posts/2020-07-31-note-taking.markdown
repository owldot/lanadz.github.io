Today I saw an interesting comment on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13874026), three years old thread made it to today's digest.

Guys were discussing interviews and different processes that are used by companies.

I liked what user YCode wrote:

<blockquote>

<p/>
Keep a daily journal of what you work on. Nothing fancy, just stop by once a day religiously and add a few notes on what you did, what meetings you attended, who you spoke with, etc...
<p/>
Save your evaluations and especially any award packages you or your team might get submitted for. At least where I work both are your supervisor's attempt to make you look as good as possible.
<p/>

Then, when you're job hunting review your notes and bullets and collect the ones that sound the best and perhaps ones that have numbers assigned to them (size, savings, productivity, etc..)

But also it's helpful as a reminder for what we are doing and what we have **achieved**.
Sprint notes are gone when you are changing company and will be too detailed to re-read, but a good old notebook (digital or real) is good to have. I will try to build a new habit.
