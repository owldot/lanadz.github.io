When you are using your mobile data you want to count your precious bytes.
And in my case I don't want to install any 3-d party apps for such a simple task.

Luckily on MacOS you have `nettop` command

```bash
nettop -n -m route -k rx_dupe -k rx_ooo -k re-tx -k rtt_avg -k conn_att -k conn_est
```

...simple like that. It will provide you with enough statistics without any additional noise
