    What I was doing recently? I must say a lot. I reviewed my JavaScript
    knowledge, looked into new things of ES6, TypeScript, React, etc.

    I am changing my mind about React. As I mentioned before I used Vue for
    <a href="https://www.owldot.com" target="_blank">OwlDot</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    2 years ago when I had little idea of modern JavaScript and it's frameworks,
    React looked hard to me and writing SPA with it was close to impossible
    (mind I had no one to talk about principles and best(or even any)
    practices). Vue looked easier, more opinionated if you will. <br />
    They had their official router, state manager and great documentation. And
    with the help of tutorial and couple online courses OwlDot was ready for
    production in less than 2 months.

  <p>
    This time I decided to look into React again, and you know it's not that
    difficult as it used to be 2 years ago. As I was told, I need to learn one
    framework and another one will be easier to pick up.

  <p>
    As an exercise, I am planning to rewrite my Vue project to React and see how
    it goes. Of course, I will share my progress here 😊
